description:Wish is the mightiest spell a mortal creature can cast. By 
simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.

higher:When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
